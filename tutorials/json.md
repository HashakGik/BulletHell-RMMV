The in-game behaviour of players and enemies is configured via a JSON file (the path of which is one of the plugin's parameters).

The general structure is the following:

    {
        "players": [
        (players' list)
        ],
        "enemies": [
        (enemies' list)
        ]
    }
    
The demo contains a fully working JSON file in `data/BulletHell.json`.
